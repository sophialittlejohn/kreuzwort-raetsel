N --> x: 3, y: 4
G --> x: 4, y: 4

First letter (N) in common index: 2 --> preLICLength

Does first half of word fit?
- if y-coord - preLICLength & one extra cell for question > 0
- if (4 - (2 + 1))  ✅


Does second half of word fit?
- if y-coord + postLICLength <= COLUMNS_COUNT --> it fits ✅
- if (4 + 2) ✅

Next Steps:

- place input over cells with letter
- track input in state
- add two fields for solution (id: 22, id: 33) at top 
- mark solutionWordCell in grid
